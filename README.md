# image_hash
Simple tool I made for creating .png images from hashed passwords using hashlib PBKDF2

# use

just run create_hashed_image(), only required parameter is password (string), rest is optional, it is very slow (512x512 can take some time, didn't checked bigger) but
I made it for making 3 texures :)

# result
![Alt text](encrypted_image.png?raw=true "Title")
